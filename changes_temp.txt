Temporary file to log changes made to repository before next major release.
This file will be deleted and properly logged once all changes are processed.

- Removed /prebuild entirely - versioning control and history can be done using github
- Removed /plists entirely - not needed or should be treated on a separate repository
- Moved contents of /bitnet folder to root (genesis and config file)
- Renamed .bitnet to public_genesis.json (easier to understand what the file is)
- Renamed .config to .nodeconfig (easier to understand what the file is)


TODO
>>> apply convention standards to repository
>>> import smart contract standards to main core repository
>>> refactor/recode build scripts (maybe use python or javascript?)
>>> general cleanup and tidying of public repo
>>> consider integrating desktop node to main core code repo (???)
