# Bitnet Public RPCs
This is a list of public RPCs you can use to connect to Bitnet. If you run an RPC and want to add it to the list, just open a pull request adding your RPC's information to the **bottom** of the list using the markdown template below:
```
## **RPC Alias**
**URL Endpoint:** https://yourendpoint.com/  
**Websocket Endpoint:** wss://yourendpoint.com/  
**Collects User Data?** [Yes/No]  
**Location:** [Americas/Europe/Asia/Africa/Undisclosed]  
**Terms of Use:** [None/Fair Usage/URL]
```
*Websocket endpoint isn't required, and you can just delte it if your RPC does not support WS connections. Markdown (MD) requires 2 blank spaces after each line for it to break properly, so don't forget that while submitting your PR.*
