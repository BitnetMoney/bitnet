# Bitnet Core: Your Gateway to Decentralized, Programmable Money

Bitnet combines the decentralization of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum, making it a dual-purpose blockchain technology. Utilize the protocol to create, transfer, and receive Bitnets, or leverage its smart contract capabilities to build complex applications—from digital assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and much more.

> **Insight**: *The only way forward is through decentralization.*

## Important Notice For Version 0.0.5 Users

If you have any issues syncing with the network, please try the following steps:

1. If you're executing the Bitnet binary directly and in a single step, try initializing the protocol genesis before starting the `bitnet` (or `bitnet.exe` on Windows) binary. You can do that by running the command below inside your Bitnet folder - it assumes you have downloaded the latest pre-build release:

```bash
./bitnet --datadir bitnet.db init .genesis && ./bitnet --networkid 210 --config .nodeconfig
```

or, if you're on Windows:

```cmd
.\bitnet --datadir bitnet.db init .genesis ; .\bitnet --networkid 210 --config .nodeconfig
```

2. Try deleting your existing database for a full resync with the network. You can use the command below to delete the `bitnet.db` folder:

```bash
rm -rf bitnet.db
```

or, if you're on Windows:

```cmd
rmdir /s /q bitnet.db
```

If after following the steps above you still cannot sync your node, please ask for help in one of our community channels. Most of our developers are more active on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dtw7rKQfRs) than in other social media platforms.

## Install Script

You can install all the necessary dependencies by running:
```shell
python install.py
```

Replace `python` with `python3` if your system is version-sensitive.

## Build From Source

Should you wish to build Bitnet from source, ensure you have the following software:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Golang 1.19+](https://go.dev/dl/) (installed by `install.py`)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) (installed by `install.py`)

> **Note**: If either of these components is missing or corrupt, the build will fail. For a pre-built version with binaries compatible with your operating system, visit our [Releases Page](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/bitnet/releases/).

---

You can run the following script to build Bitnet from source:
```shell
python build.py
```

Replace `python` with `python3` if your system is version-sensitive.

Alternatively you can bypass the Python build script by using Go and GCC directly:
```shell
go run build/ci.go install ./cmd/bitnet
```
