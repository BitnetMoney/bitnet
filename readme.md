# Bitnet Core
Bitnet is decentralized like Bitcoin, but powerful like Ethereum. Bitnet is a decentralized technology that powers programmable money. Much like Bitcoin, users can make use of the protocol to generate, send, and receive Bitnets among themselves, and like Ethereum, it is also compatible with smart contract and can be used to develop complex subprotocols that can power programmable money, digital assets, non-fungibles, decentralized autonomous organizations and more.

It has no pre-mined supply, and for a while after the launch, anyone with a regular PC will be able to setup a node, mine, and generate Bitnets. By doing that you will help securing the network and keeping it decentralized. Bitnet can be used with any EVM-compatible wallet, including **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)**.

*There is only one way forward, and it is decentralization.*

## The project needs volunteers! 🤝
*A message from Masayoshi K.*

Bitnet is a grassroots and decentralized project, that has no foundation, no org, no venture capitalists, and no financial backing of any type. It counts on people like you and I to exist and develop the technology, and it is currently needing to fill the following volunteer positions:

**Developers:** the Bitnet vision involves a lot of development and programming. Anyone with the skills able to help the project on that front will be very welcomed. The implementation of Bitnet is writen in Golang, but the project can certainly benefit from developers of other programming languages, as there are other projects I believe Bitnet can benefit from that I would want to initiate if we have the manpower in place to do so, including a desktop wallet and a mobile payment application.

**Documentation Writing:** the documents for the project need to be written and made available to the public. This will make easier for new developers to onboard, as well as give clarity to technical users as for the differences between Bitnet and Ethereum. My idea was to use a public space like Gitbook or similar to host it, as it is familiar and broadly used in the industry. The requirements for writing the documents would be a general understanding on how the protocol works, and to have good communication skills. The first round of documents will be done in English and further transalated into other languages at a later date.

**Community Management:** as the project evolves, the expectation is that more management and moderation will be needed across our different communities, and anyone willing to help can come forth. It can be with simple moderation, improvements, enhancements, engagement, or anything else that can add value to Bitnet and the community around it.

**Evangelists:** Bitnet is built out of strong principles, and promotes inclusion, parity, fairness, and true decentralisation. These are values that we need to spread, and if you are a community leader or influencer of any kind and wants to help Bitnet grow, you can do that by yourself or reach out to other collaborators with any requests you might have that will help you in your journey. It can be something as simple as banner - I'm sure this community will be willing to help.

## Building from Source

To build from the source, you will need both **[Golang 1.19+](https://go.dev/dl/)** and a **C Compiler** installed to build Bitnet. If any of the two is missing or corrupt, your build will not work.
  
*You don't need to build from the source to run a local node. For that, you can just download the latest pre-built version for your operational system and use it to run your node. Go to the [the releases page](/BitnetMoney/bitnet/releases) for download links.*

### Linux/MacOS
You can build Bitnet in your Linux or MacOS device using the command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/BitnetMoney/bitnet.git && cd bitnet && bash build.linux.sh
```
*Replace it with `bash.build.mac` if you're using a MacOS device.*

### Windows
You can build Bitnet in your Windows device using the command below:
```
git clone https://github.com/BitnetMoney/bitnet.git ; cd bitnet ; .\build.win
```

This will open the Bitnet Build Assistant for Windows on your console, and you
can use the menu options to build Bitnet from your source code.
