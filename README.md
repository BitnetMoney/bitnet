# Bitnet
Bitnet is a decentralized technology that powers programmable money. Anyone can generate
Bitnets through mining, and until the network becomes widely used, anyone with a regular
PC can do so.

# Building
Bitnet requires both **[Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)** and a **C Compiler**.

## Linux and MacOS
You can install Bitnet in your Linux or MacOS device using the command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/masayoshikob/bitnet.git && cd bitnet && sudo bash build.unix.sh
```

## Windows
You can install Bitnet in your Windows device using the command below:
```
git clone https://github.com/masayoshikob/bitnet.git ; cd bitnet ; .\build.win
```

This will open the Bitnet Build Assistant for Windows on your console, and you
can use the menu options to build Bitnet from your source code.
