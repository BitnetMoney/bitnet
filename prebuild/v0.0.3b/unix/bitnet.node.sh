# This script will regiter and initiate the mainnet genesis file
# and start your node. You can change the flag "--config" from
# ".rpc" (default) to ".node" if you do not want to accept any
# incoming API requests from users. By doing that you will also
# block most wallets (such as MetaMask, for example) from connecting
# to your node, but you will still be able to use the console to
# send transactions and make API calls.

# This script requires chmod 755.
